# arduino-door-lock-demo

Currently, this project is pretty much a clone of https://github.com/auth0/drink-dispenser-demo. The goal is to use OAuth2 device flow to authenticate a user and unlock a door.

## Components
* **Development board:** Arduino Uno WiFi Rev2
* **NFC Shield:** X-Nucleo-NFC04A1
* **Solenoid:** [Lock-style Solenoid - 12VDC](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1512)

## TODO

* Replace drink dispenser functiolity with solenoid functionality
